This app started as part of the Class of January 2017 CampusCode Immersion Web training.
More details on the immersion program can be found at: https://www.campuscode.com.br/imersao-web
The beta version, as finished during the program is online at: http://bonitobeta.herokuapp.com/

The app's main goal is providing those who travel to Bonito MS Brazil, or work with the area's tourism somehow, with a tool that quickly provides accurate pricing for the tours.

The vision is to become a household name in terms of price research.
