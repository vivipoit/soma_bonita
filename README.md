# README

This app started as part of the Class of January 2017 CampusCode Immersion Web training.
More details on the immersion program can be found at https://www.campuscode.com.br/imersao-web.
The beta version, as finished during the program is online at http://bonitobeta.herokuapp.com/.

The app's main goal is to provide those who travel to Bonito MS Brazil, or work with the area's tourism in any way, with a tool that takes the pricing complexity away and returns quick, simple results.

The vision is to become a household name in terms of Bonito price research.

We're currently online at http://somabonita.herokuapp.com/
